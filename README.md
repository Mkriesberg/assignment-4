This map is designed to present information about rapid transit communities, as classified under the MBTA Communities Act. Passed in 2019, the MBTA Communities Act requires cities and towns served by the state's public transportation authority (MBTA) to create a new zoning district near an MBTA stop that allows multi-family housing by-right. The first set of rezonings must happen in so-called rapid transit communities. 

The information provided in this map includes a communities' compliance status, new total zoning capacity requirement, and a link to their city/town's planning department.

To use the map, click on any rapid transit community. The information will appear in a text box on the left side of the screen
